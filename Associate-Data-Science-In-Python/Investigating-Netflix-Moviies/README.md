# 🎬 Investigating Netflix Movies
## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I applied data manipulation and visualization techniques to a Netflix dataset to see if movie durations have been getting shorter over time. This analysis was completed as part of the DataCamp "Investigating Netflix Movies" project.

## 📊 Objective
The goal was to filter and analyze the dataset to determine if the average length of movies has changed, specifically focusing on the most recent decade and certain genres.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
* **Data Filtering:** Using Pandas to isolate movies and filter out TV shows.
* **Feature Selection:** Creating new DataFrames containing only relevant columns like `title`, `country`, `genre`, `release_year`, and `duration`.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating scatter plots with Matplotlib to visualize movie lengths over time.
* **Conditional Logic:** Using loops and colors to categorize different genres (e.g., Children, Documentaries, Stand-Up) within the visualization.
