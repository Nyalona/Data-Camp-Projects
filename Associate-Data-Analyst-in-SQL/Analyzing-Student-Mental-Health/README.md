# 🧠 Analyzing Student Mental Health
## 📌 Project Overview
This project examines whether staying in a foreign country affects the mental health of international students. Using SQL, I analyzed data from a Japanese international university to see if length of stay correlates with diagnostic scores for depression, social anxiety, and acculturative stress.

## 📊 Key Analytical Steps
- **Data Exploration:** Inspecting the dataset to understand the distribution of students.
- **SQL Aggregation:** Using functions like `MIN()`, `MAX()`, and `ROUND()` to summarize diagnostic scores (PHQ-9, SCS, ASISS).
- **Correlation Analysis:** Grouping results by the length of stay (`stay`) to see how mental health scores change over time.
- **Filtering:** Ensuring the analysis only focused on international students.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Queries:** Writing complex queries involving filtering (`WHERE`), grouping (`GROUP BY`), and ordering (`ORDER BY`).
- **Data Summarization:** Calculating averages and ranges to find trends in health metrics.
- **Analytical Thinking:** Interpreting how environmental factors like "Length of Stay" impact psychological well-being.
